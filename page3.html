		<h1>What They Did:</h1>
		<p>Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani activist who became an international symbol of the fight for girls'
			education. She hails
			from the Swat Valley in Pakistan, where the Taliban had imposed a ban on girls attending school. Despite
			threats and
			danger, Malala continued to pursue her education and speak out against the restrictions. Malala faced grave
			dangers and adversity, including the attack on her life. However, she continued her activism and
			became a voice for the millions of girls worldwide who are denied access to education. She was forced to
			leave her home in Pakistan but has since continued her education in the United Kingdom while
			continuing her advocacy work.</p>
